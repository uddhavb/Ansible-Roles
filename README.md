Configuration Management using Ansible    
    
## Configuration Management   
The [main.yml](main.yml) calls the two .yml files(one for coffeemaker and the other for selenium testing). These scripts in turn call the roles that are defined in the roles directory, wherever necessary.   
In the respective roles directories, there are tasks directories that have the .yml files for running the particular role.
